HI, I'M ZOYA! 

I'm a student from India. 

I currently study as an 11th grade student from science and tech background, also learn to code in various programming languages and freelance sometimes. 

Math, physics and technology just keep fascinating me. I'm driven by the curiousity to understand how the universe works and a desire to create solutions that have an impact. 

I believe in combining technical knowledge with entrepreneurial skills to build innovative products and meaningful ventures. Aspiring to be a business person, engineer, develepor at the same time. 

Alongside I just love cars, someday I'd love to be at a team in F1 as their engineer. Travelling and exprolring fuels my creativity and broadens my perspective. Apart from this I find my escape in music, art and poetry. 

I'm excited to be at new and good places and meet different people with varying ideas and skills.
